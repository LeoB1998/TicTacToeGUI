Tic-Tac-Toe Project Description
Tic-Tac-Toe is a small card game that can be played by two people, or as an option, it can be a player vs. non-player. 

Software requirements

Our Tic-Tac-Toe game will be a Java based game for Windows which will request low memory at run time, and small install space. The game will require a Java compiler in order for the game to run.  Priority version of the Windows system is 10th for this game.

Description

 The game of 2 players taking turns placing their marks in a 3 x 3 grid, in order to outmatch and succeed by placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row. The game can eventually be strategized with certain placements which allows advantages towards the upper hand and victory of your opponent.

Goal 

The goal of our project is to create the experience of Tic Tac Toe on a UI in order to mimic the creations of the game that were originally played on a piece of paper. 

Features

Our project will have multiple components including a UI, Options to play against another player or against a CPU (Central Processing Unit), Game Rules that will be displayed at the start of a new game, Settings to change user’s marks (e.g. X’s and O’s), and a Scoring and leaderboard system that will track each player’s wins and losses throughout the period of play.
